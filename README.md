# Docker-Project
For this project I followed a guide from Medhat Elmasry building a PHP and MySQL Web App. I added my own twist by cloning an HTML page and adding it to the web page.
1. To start, you need a machine running with Docker installed, navigate to (https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) to get started.
2. From your home directory, create and change to a new directory for this project, I named mine _php-mysql-app_: ```mkdir php-mysql-app``` followed by ```cd php-mysql-app```. Your command line should now look like this:<br/>![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71033480/155025361-f91cb2a8-f1c6-4fd1-85ae-26094774ef1e.png)
3. From withing _php-mysql-app_ create a directory called _src_, this will be used to store the source code: ```mkdir src```.
4.
